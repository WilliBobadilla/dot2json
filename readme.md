## Use of the tool :hammer:

1. Write your dot notation definition in the text inputs that area in the left of the interface.
2. It will render automatically the output in the right panel (textarea) of the interface.
3. You can add more fields for your dot definition clicking **+** button, an also with **enter** key.
4. Clear button is to clear both areas. It clears all the content.
